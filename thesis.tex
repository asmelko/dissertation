\chapter{GPU optimizations of data-intensive scientific algorithms}



\section{Hierarchical clustering with Mahalanobis distance}

In the field of bioinformatics, the hierarchical clustering is a popular method for analyzing gene expression data.
The hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that aims to group the data points into clusters based on their similarity.

Although hierarchical clustering is a simple algorithm, the parallel implementation faces challanges in the form of load balancing.
It gets more complex with the computationally expensive Mahalanobis distance, which is used to measure the similarity of the data points.

\subsection{Definition of hierarchical clustering}

\subsection{Definition of Mahalanobis distance}

mention multiple ways of subthreshold handling 

\subsection{Prior solution and its limitations}

\subsection{Optimized solution}

nearest neighbor array instead of dissimilarity matrix to reduce space complexity and enable 1M data points

neighbor buffer - more than just one neighbor

task parallelism using streams



\section{Neighborhood-based dimensionality reduction}

definition of dimensionality reduction

limitations of real time processing


optimizations:

memory-heavy stuff:
- using registers as caches
- vector loads

\section{Cross-correlation}

much more detailed register usage 

\section{Stochastic simulation of Boolean networks}

definition of stochastic simulation

limitations of real time processing

runtime compilation and linkage of model code

\chapter{Streamlining the development of parallel algorithms using Noarr}

what are memory layouts 

introduce the abstraction

what can we do with it? layout agnostic code

what more? traversal transformations

\section{memory layouts}

\section{layout agnostic code}
