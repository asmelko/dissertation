	abstract = {Computational models in systems biology are becoming more important with the advancement of experimental techniques to query the mechanistic details responsible for leading to phenotypes of interest. In particular, Boolean models are well fit to describe the complexity of signaling networks while being simple enough to scale to a very large number of components. With the advance of Boolean model inference techniques, the field is transforming from an artisanal way of building models of moderate size to a more automatized one, leading to very large models. In this context, adapting the simulation software for such increases in complexity is crucial. We present two new developments in the continuous time Boolean simulators: MaBoSS.MPI, a parallel implementation of MaBoSS which can exploit the computational power of very large CPU clusters, and MaBoSS.GPU, which can use GPU accelerators to perform these simulations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Dimensionality reduction methods have found vast applications as visualization tools in diverse areas of science. Although many different methods exist, their performance is often insufficient for providing quick insight into many contemporary datasets. In this paper, we propose a highly optimized GPU implementation of EmbedSOM, a dimensionality reduction algorithm based on self-organizing maps. We detail the optimizations of k-NN search and 2D projection kernels which comprise the core of the algorithm. To tackle the thread divergence and low arithmetic intensity, we use a modified bitonic sort for k-NN search and a projection kernel that utilizes vector loads and register caches. The evaluated performance benchmarks indicate that the optimized EmbedSOM implementation is capable of projecting over 30 million individual data points per second.},
