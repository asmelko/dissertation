\chapter{Employing GPUs in scientific algorithms}

The information age has brought a massive increase in the amount of data that is being collected and processed. The `data explosion' can be observed in virtually every field of computer science. In the scientific domain, this phenomenon is multiplied by increasingly powerful data-gathering devices (i.e., cytometers in bioinformatics, optic sensors in physics, seismometers in geology, etc.). The amount of data is simply too large to be processed in the required time. In order to alleviate this apparent pressure, the corresponding algorithm (which typically has super-linear time complexity) must be ported to massively parallel architectures, such as GPUs. The provided advantage can result in the ability to assess bigger data, use more detailed processing methods, or analyze the data in real time.

This chapter enumerates four selected scientific algorithms and discusses their challenges in porting to GPUs to enable higher performance.

\section{Hierarchical clustering with the Ma\-ha\-la\-no\-bis linkage}

In the field of bioinformatics, hierarchical clustering is a popular method for analyzing various types of data. 
In general, hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that aims to group the data points into clusters according to some \emph{linkage criterion}.
Clustering is an iterative method that begins with each data point interpreted as a single cluster and, in each iteration, the two most similar clusters are merged with respect to a linkage criterion until a single cluster remains.
There are many cluster linkage criteria used in the field, each with advantages and disadvantages. 
Perhaps the most common linkage may be the \emph{centroid linkage}, which defines cluster similarity as the distance between their centroids (the mean points). In this section, we will discuss the hierarchical clustering with the \emph{Mahalanobis linkage}, a more sophisticated method suitable for analyzing multidimensional single-cell cytometry datasets.

Mahalanobis linkage uses \emph{Mahalanobis distance}~\cite{mahalanobis1936generalized} to measure the similarity between clusters:
\begin{defn}[Mahalanobis distance]
    Suppose a probability distribution $C$ on $\R^d$ with mean $\bar{C} \in \R^d$ and a convariance matrix $\cov(C)$. If the matrix $\cov(C)$ is regular, we define the \emph{Mahalanobis distance} between $u \in \R^d$ and $C$ as
    \begin{equation}
    d_\text{Maha}(u,C) = \sqrt{(u-\bar{C})^T\cov(C)^{-1}(u-\bar{C})}.
    \end{equation}\label{eq01:maha}
\end{defn}

If we generalize a centroid of a cluster to a probability distribution, Definition~\ref{eq01:maha} can be used to define the Mahalanobis distance between a point and a cluster. To extend the definition to a distance between two clusters, we use the following equation~\cite{fivser2012detection}:
\begin{equation}
    \delta_\text{Maha}(P,Q) = \frac{d_\text{Maha}(\bar{P},Q) + d_\text{Maha}(\bar{Q},P)}{2}
\end{equation}\label{eq01:maha_linkage}

To illustrate the measure of the Mahalanobis distance, let us suppose we have two elliptic clusters. In the means of the proximity, the measure favors such clusters that their ellipses are alongside rather than in a prolongation of one another~\cite{dagnelie1991using} (see Figure~\ref{fig:ellipses}). 
Only when the objects of a cluster form a spherical shape, this dissimilairity measure is proportional to the Euclidean distance with a corresponding linkage.

\subsection{Background}

The prior work, which is our optimization based upon, is that of Fišer et al.~\cite{fivser2012detection}. They proposed the Mahalanobis hierarchical clustering as a valuable tool for analysis of flow cytometry datasets. Flow cytometric analysis is used (not exclusively) in minimal residual desease monitoring of hematologic malignancies. As a fast and sensitive method, it has been incorporated into several clinical trials of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 

However, the size of obtained flow cytometry datasets is constantly growing, which creates new challenges for the analysis. Modern flow cytometers are able to process samples with millions of cells and measure tens of parameters (point dimensions) simultaneously. More traditional methods, such as manual gating, are not suitable for such high-dimensional data and are heavily observer-dependent. Automated hierarchical clustering methods offer a viable solution but often fail to reflect the elliptical shapes of flow cytometric populations. 

For this purpose, the authors proposed the Mahalanobis linkage. This allows for a very natural formation of clusters in biological data. However, the benefits come at a cost of a high time and space complexity. The author claim the upper usable bound of dataset size to be $10^4$ using the original \texttt{C} application. The quadratic space complexity makes for the most significant limiting factor, making it unfeasible to analyze bigger datasets on current desktop computers.

The authors tried to alleviate this limitation by implementing the approximation of \emph{apriori clusters}, where the data was pre-clustered using a naive euclidean-based linkage reducing the overall size of the dataset. This increased the usability of the original code to datasets of around $10^6$ data points within an interactive environment~\cite{kratochvil2020shinysom}. Still, the proposed optimization could not keep up with the contemporary data aquisition methods, generating datasets of millions of multidimensional data points.



% We analyzed datasets with n = 10^4 events as the distance of data points requires O(n2) space in memory, and therefore, it becomes impractical (or even impossible) to analyze bigger datasets on current desktop computers.

% IN childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), response to therapy as measured by minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring is an important biomarker for predicting relapse and stratifying treatment (1–5).

% , flow cytometry generates increasingly large and information-rich
% datasets, which provide new challenges for analysis. Modern multilaser flow cytometers are able to simultaneously measure up to 12 or more parameters and acquire
% such information from millions of single cells (8,9)

% Traditional gating of populations
% on two-parameter plots is tedious and does not reflect the multidimensionality of the data. Moreover, both the setting of the gates and interpretation of the results are observer-dependent and require intensive training and high levels of expertise. 

% Although hierarchical clustering methods
% can place each cell in its hierarchical context within the analyzed dataset, their downside is that they often fail to reflect
% the elliptical shapes of flow cytometric population

% However, the rapidly rising complexity of multiparameter
% flow cytometry datasets creates new challenges. Currently, the
% analytical standard in the field involves gating, in which one
% or more gates are defined in each histogram or dual parameter
% plot and a sequence or combination of gates defines the population of interest. This process is tedious or even unfeasible, already requires highly experienced cytometrists and is observer
% dependent. Most importantly, the sequential gating is limited
% in its ability to reflect the multidimensionality of the data. A
% solution to both the multidimensionality of flow data and the
% observer dependency lies in the usage of unsupervised learning
% methods.

% C version of the algorithm has been implemented within R package mhca and enhanced with the possibility of assuming
% apriori clusters for approximation, to reduce the unfavorable O(n3) time complexity for large datasets. That allowed the authors to process datasets of around

\subsection{Algorithm complexity and the implementation}

From the perspective of GPU programming, Mahalanobis Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is a challenging problem. Algorithms with a high memory requirements are generally unfavorable for GPUs due to their limited DRAM. There has been a lot of work on overcoming this limitation, both from NVIDIA and the scientific community~\cite{zheng2016towards,kim2020batch,landaverde2014investigation}. CUDA has introduced \emph{unified memory}~\cite{site:cuda}, which allowed GPUs to work on data that exceeds GPU memory capacity by seamlesly copying data from CPU to GPU on page fault. This optimization can help only to a certain extent, as it can only scale to the size of CPU RAM and the data are usually sent through high-latency small-throughput interconnect. Therefore, in our work we experimented with other well-known HC variants which trade higher asymptotic time complexity for a linear memory complexity --- \emph{HC with the nearest neighbor array}~\cite{day1984efficient}. Furthermore, the execution on the real-world flow cytometry data showed that the average cost of the nearest neighbor array update is much lower than the worst case.


The other obstacle of Mahalanobis HC is the greatly imbalanced workload. In the first iterations, the runtime is dominated by the complex Mahalanobis linkage computation over many pairs of $n$ clusters. But as the number of clusters decreases, the hot-spot becomes the computation of the covariance matrix of a merged cluster, which has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d^2 \cdot c)$, where $d$ is the number of dimensions of the data and $c$ is the size of the cluster. It could happen on many inputs, that for the most time during the computation, the GPU is not fully utilized either due to small amount of parallelism in covariance matrix computation or in the similarity computation. For that case, we designed a workload which uses CUDA \emph{streams}~\cite{site:cuda} that enables overlap the execution of mutliple GPU kernels and memory transfers. This allowed us to keep the utilization of more GPU cores during the whole runtime of the algorithm.

As a result, the optimized Mahalanobis HC achieves a speedup of over $1400\times$ compared to the original serial CPU implementation. We benchmarked the application on the real-world single-cytometry datasets. The biggest dataset which we obtained, the Samusik-All~\cite{flowrepo} ($841$K points of $39$D), was able to finish in the order of minutes compared to the order of days. The application has been distributed as a R package \texttt{gmhc} to fit a workflows of carrried out by a bioinformatics comunity. As of our knowledge, the package enabled the scientists to analyze big datasets as a whole, without the apriori clustering approximation, increasing the accuracy of the analysed data and decreasing the turnaround time of the analysis.  

% Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is a well-known problem, and there are many algorithms that effectively solve it. Roughly, they can be divided into categories according to the data structures they employ [TODO]:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item HC with a dissimilarity matrix --- the most straightforward approach; the dissimilarity matrix stores the distances between all pairs of clusters. This approach has a cubic time complexity and quadratic memory complexity.
%     \item HC with a nearest neighbor array --- each cluster stores the index of its nearest neighbor. This approach trades a linear memory complexity for an asymptotic time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \cdot n^3)$.
%     \item HC with an array of priority queues --- a more sophisticated solution, which reduces the time complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$.
% \end{itemize}

% C application \texttt{mhclust}, the original implementation of the Mahalanobis HC, uses the dissimilarity matrix. This approach is simple and allows for a straightforward implementation. However, the empirical data reveal the most significant limiting factor in the quadratic memory complexity. The Mahalanobis distance adds a multiplicative factor in $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ to the memory complexity, so usually, the machine runs out of memory before the execution time reaches unreasonable limits.

% As a solution to this limitation, we can assume \emph{in-place} variant of the HC with dissimilarity matrix, which discards the whole matrix and chooses the closest cluster pair by computing the distances ad-hoc. This increases the asymptotic time complexity to $\mathcal{O}(d \cdot n^3)$ assuming the Euclidean distance with centroid linkage.

% Our work used the nearest neighbor array approach to achieve fewer distance computations per iteration on average while keeping the memory complexity linear. Notably, the algorithm complexity per iteration is quadratic only in the worst case, when each cluster's neighbor needs to be reevaluated. This case would correspond to constantly merging such cluster pairs that all the other clusters are neighboring. In practice, this is an atypical case, and the empirical data show that the number of neighbors to reevaluate is generally in the range of 10 to 100 for tested datasets with at most 1M of points.

% Apart from the complex distance computation, the Mahalanobis HC suffers from the unbalanced nature of the algorithm. In the first iterations, the runtime is dominated by the distance computation in the data structure update. However, when the number of clusters decreases, the bottleneck becomes the covariance matrix computation of a merged cluster (with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d^2 \cdot n)$). We used \emph{streams}, a CUDA abstraction for task parallelism on GPUs, to overlap the covariance matrix computation with the data structure update to keep GPU utilization high.

% \subsection{Future work}

% The Mahalanobis HC is a valuable method for analyzing cytometry data. However, since we published the optimized algorithm, there have been new additions to the GPU CUDA framework, which could be used to improve the performance of the algorithm further. Specifically, the whole Mahalanobis distance could be computed as a single \emph{Tensor} operation, drastically improving the application throughput. Another promising optimization would be to use \emph{CUDA Graph} to reduce the kernel launch overhead.


\section{Neighborhood-based dimensionality reduction}

Another approach to the analysis of multidimensional point-like cloud datasets is to reduce the dimensionality of the data to a lower (human-readable) dimension while preserving the local structure of the data. This approach is used in many areas of life sciences, such as microscopy imaging, population biology, and others. The most popular methods for dimensionality reduction are t-SNE and UMAP. Both these methods are nonlinear neighborhood embeddings and use a stochastic approach to find the optimal mapping. However, their applicability reaches a limit when increasing the scale or requiring real-time processing.

The EmbedSOM algorithm tries to tackle this limitation. It is based on self-organizing maps and uses a landmarks-based approach to reduce the computational complexity. Instead of computing all pairwise distances and stochastically optimizing the low-dimensional mapping, EmbedSOM uses a small set of landmarks to approximate the mapping. This allows for over a magnitude better performance while retaining the reasonable accuracy of the results. In our works, we followed up on the EmbedSOM algorithm and implemented it on GPUs to achieve real-time processing of large datasets, allowing for a semi-supervised dataset analysis.

\subsection{Backgound}

Algorithm~\ref{alg01:esom} highlights the overview of EmbedSOM algorithm. It assumes a set of $n$ high-dimensional (denoted with $d$) points $X \in \R^{n \times d}$, a set of $g << n$ high-dimensional landmarks $L \in \R^{g \times d}$, and a set of $g$ low-dimensional ($2$ for brevity) landmarks $l \in \R^{g \times 2}$. For each high-dimensional point, it finds a low-dimensional variant by selecting $k < g$ nearest landmarks, assigning them scores, and computing the optimal low-dimensional mapping according to the scores. The optimal mapping is computed by minimizing the sum of the differences between the distances of the high-dimensional point to the landmarks and the distances of the low-dimensional point to the landmarks. Because of the mapping nature, the minimization problem can be reduced to a linear system of equations with two variables.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
    \caption{EmbedSOM}
    \label{alg01:esom}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Procedure{EmbedSOM}{$X\in\R^{n\times d}$, $L\in\R^{g\times d}$, $l\in\R^{g\times 2}$, $k\in\N$}
        \For {$i \in \{1\dots n\}$} \Comment{For each high-dimensional point}
            \State Find $k$ nearest landmarks from $L$
            \State Score the $k$ nearest landmarks according to the distance to $X_i$ with $s_1, \dots, s_k$
            \For {$(u,v) \in \{1,\dots,k\}^2$ } \Comment{For each pair of nearest landmarks}
                \State Compute $D_{uv}(X_i)$ by projecting $X_i$ orthogonally onto a line between $L_u$ and $L_v$; We define $d_{uv}(x)$ similarly for $l_u$ and $l_v$
            \EndFor
            \State Find $x_i$, such that $\sum_{u, v} s_u \cdot s_v \cdot (D_{uv}(X_i) - d_{uv}(x_i))$ is minimized
        \EndFor
        \EndProcedure
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Let us divide the algorithm into two well-separated parts: The first part shall be the algorithm's first line, also known as the \emph{$k$NN search}, and the remainder of the algorithm for the second part, \emph{the projection}. Considering such division, the time complexities roughly follow $\mathcal{O}(n\cdot d \cdot g \cdot \log k)$ for $k$NN and $\mathcal{O}(n\cdot d \cdot k^2)$ for the projection.

\subsection{Implementation}

The main challenge of both steps is fighting the \emph{arithmetic intensity}. GPUs are very prone to being memory bound; for the sake of context, Tesla V100 has ops per byte ratio of $16$ \texttt{FLOPS/B} and around $140$ \texttt{FLOPS/B} when we also account for the Tensor cores (assuming single precision arithmetics). Therefore, in order to enable the GPU to perform at its peak, we generally need to design the implementation such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the data are cached in a smart way and reused as much as possible, or
    \item we increase the GPU occupancy, such that the latencies of data retrieval are hidden by the scheduler.
\end{itemize}

We experimented with both approaches in our implementation. $k$NN algorithm is suited for data sharing since the data for one point from $X$ can be shared among multiple landmarks to compute the distances (or vice-versa). The best arithmetic intensity is achieved when both the data and the landmarks are cached. We complemented this variant with the kernel that uses bitonic sort for top-$k$ selection, which promotes high occupancy.

The projection step is especially challenging because each point has a potentially different set of nearest landmarks, limiting the data-sharing possibilities. This is exacerbated even more by low parameter values of $k$ in a general EmbedSOM use. To remedy this, we experimented with more advanced GPU techniques to increase the arithmetic intensity. We utilized \emph{vector load instructions}, which fetch multiple floating point numbers from the memory. This improves the memory bandwidth and reduces the number of issued instructions for the sake of lower parallelism. We combined this with the \emph{register caching}, a second caching level, which allowed us to compute multiple projections per one data transfer from the shared memory. 

After the thorough benchmarking process, we selected the most performing variants of both steps and combined them into a complete implementation of the EmbedSOM algorithm. Further contributions in this topic include the works of a collaborating master student, who integrated the optimized code into the graphical application \emph{BlosSOM} [TODO], and reported a responsive frame rate at analyzing big datasets, assessing this method of dimensionality reduction as a competitive tool for semi-supervised dataset analysis.

\section{Cross-Correlation optimized for small inputs}

We have already alluded that arithmetic intensity is a crucial factor in the performance of GPU algorithms. The algorithm described in this section stresses the importance of data caching when working with highly parallel machines, especially when dealing with data-bound problems.

Cross-correlation plays a major role in signal processing and can be found in many fields of science, such as image processing, seismology, particle physics, etc. It is used to quantify the dissimilarity between two signals by computing a measure of similarity between all their shifts. The cross-correlation of two discrete functions $f$ and $g$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    (f \star g)(\tau) = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} f(i) g(i+\tau).
\end{equation} 

Figure~\ref{fig:cross-correlation} depicts the visual representation of the equation applied to a 2-dimensional discrete case with two matrices. Although the formula is quite simple, the complexity of the 2D variant reaches $\mathcal{O}(w^2 \cdot h^2)$, where $w$ and $h$ are widths and heights of input matrices, respectively. Luckily, cross-correlation can be reduced into a problem solvable by a Fourier algorithm [TODO] with a more pleasing time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(w\cdot h \cdot \log(w\cdot h))$. Yet, the hidden multiplicative factor, which materializes as an overhead in the implementations of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), favors the definition-based approach for small problem sizes.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/cc.png}
    \caption{Visual representation of the cross-correlation. Yellow and purple matrices correspond to the input matrices, and the blue matrix depicts the cross-correlation output. The coordinates on the blue matrix correspond to the shift of the yellow matrix, which is depicted on the right. Only the overlapping parts (in pink) contribute to the computation for each output matrix element.}
    \label{fig:cross-correlation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Implementation}

The definition-based approach is a straightforward implementation of the cross-correlation formula. It is a simple algorithm that computes the dot product for all $(2w - 1) \cdot (2h -1)$ overlaps of input matrices. The algorithm is highly parallelizable but suffers from a relatively significant workload imbalance (since each overlap comprises a different number of matrix elements) and a low baseline arithmetic intensity if we do not consider any data-sharing techniques. 

\paragraph{Irregular workload} In our work, we addressed this issue by experimenting with different workers. Having multiple levels of parallelism on contemporary GPUs allows us to experiment with different `work groups' to assign them to a single overlap computation. Generally, we can choose from a \emph{warp}, a \emph{block}, or a \emph{grid} of threads on CUDA platform (in the hierarchically ascending order)\footnote{The most recent versions of CUDA introduces one more group of threads hierarchically located between a block and a grid called a \emph{block cluster}.}. They all have different ways to synchronize and share data, with a typically increasing penalty as we ascend the hierarchy. Notably, threads in a warp support data-sharing constructs within the fastest memory on a GPU --- the register file. 

In our work, we analyzed the memory traces produced by fetching the data during the computation of the neighboring overlaps. A usable memory pattern emerges if the overlapping data is read in a typical row-major pattern. A thread $t$ in iteration $i$ requires the same data as a thread $t-1$ at iteration $i-1$. Such a pattern favors the warp-level parallelism with high-throughput shuffle intrinsics, which allow for shuffling data within thread registers. In our work, we utilized the \emph{register buffer} to read ahead the data for immediate sharing.

Such work distribution enabled a moderate baseline for data sharing, increasing the arithmetic intensity of the algorithm. We also experimented with other work groups, such as assigning multiple threads or the whole block to a single overlap computation. This helped when the overall achievable parallelism was low when processing extremely small inputs.

\paragraph{Data sharing} To further increase the arithmetic intensity, we experimented with other data-sharing techniques that the problem allowed, such as sharing the same overlapping elements between neighboring overlaps. In a \emph{one-to-many} use case, where cross-correlation is computed between one left matrix and multiple right matrices, data loaded from the left matrix can be shared among multiple right matrix overlaps. Respectively, in the \emph{n-to-m} use case, the same can be done with the right matrix. 

Notably, all the mentioned sharing techniques are orthogonal to each other and can be freely combined. Naturally, the growing register requirements with each combined technique are bounded by a limit in the size of the register file (typically around 64KB) and the number of registers, which can be assigned to a single thread by a compiler. If the limit is reached, occupancy drops or register spilling occurs. Apart from that, one also has to consider the decreased parallelism that inherently comes with data sharing.

Therefore, to find the perfect balance between data sharing and the level of parallelism, we conducted a thorough benchmarking process and created the optimization matrix for the cross-correlation algorithm. It generally showed, that the high-overhead FFT implementation provides plenty of space for the definition-based approach to shine, even on a moderately sized n-to-m problem instances.
