\chapter{Streamlining the development of parallel algorithms using Noarr}

- many scientific algorithms are centered around a master data structure
  - examples (matmul, transposition, physicell, ...)
- the optimal run of these algorithms require an efficient memory traversal over the master data structure (both memory layout and traversal order) (both parallel and serial)
- the domain experts usually can guess the optimal / close to optimal layout and traversal order
- however, some optimizations require complex traversals that are very complex and error-prone to implement (tiling, levenstein, ...)
- moreover, some traversting constants require tuning for different hardware (atlas)
- other example is of a non expert who wants to speed up code by optimizing traversal - examples?
  - there exist some dsls that can help with this
- making this all by hand is very error-prone and time-consuming, unmantainable
